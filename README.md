# Bangla Chatbot using GPT-2

This repository contains a fine-tuned GPT-2 model for generating responses in Bangla. The chatbot is designed to handle conversations and provide meaningful replies in Bangla.

## Features
- Fine-tuned Bangla GPT-2 model
- Interactive chatbot interface
- Supports text-based queries
- Easily customizable and extendable

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdzubayerhossain/Bangla-Chatbot-using-GPT-2.git
cd Bangla-Chatbot-using-GPT-2
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training the Model
To train the chatbot model, run the following command:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

This will fine-tune the GPT-2 model on the provided dataset.

## Running the Chatbot
Once the model is trained, you can start the chatbot using:

```bash
python src/chatbot.py
```

After running the command, the chatbot will prompt you to enter text. You can chat with the bot by typing messages in Bangla.

## Example Usage
```bash
ü§ñ Bangla Chatbot (type 'exit' to stop)

You: ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶á
Bot: ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶á! ‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶Æ‡¶® ‡¶Ü‡¶õ‡ßá‡¶®?

You: ‡¶ñ‡¶æ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶¨‡ßú‡¶ø ‡¶ï‡¶ø‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶¨‡ßá ‡¶ñ‡¶æ‡¶¨
Bot: ‡¶ñ‡¶æ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶¨‡ßú‡¶ø ‡¶∏‡¶†‡¶ø‡¶ï‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶¨‡ßá ‡¶ó‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶π‡¶£‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶ú‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶•‡¶Æ‡ßá ... (appropriate response)
```

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues related to TensorFlow, ensure that your environment is properly configured.
- If you see warnings about `do_sample` or `attention_mask`, check the chatbot script and modify the generation settings accordingly.
- If the bot's responses seem irrelevant, consider retraining the model with a better dataset.
